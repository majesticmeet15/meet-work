What is OOP? List OOP concepts

 
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++ focuses on using "objects" to model real-world entities. Key OOP concepts include:

1. Class : Blueprint for creating objects with data and methods.
2. Object : Instance of a class containing data and methods.
3. Encapsulation : Bundling data and methods, restricting access using access specifiers (public, protected, private).
4. Inheritance : Creating new classes from existing ones to reuse and extend functionality.
5. Polymorphism : Using the same interface for different data types, achieved through function overloading and virtual functions.
6. Abstraction : Hiding complex implementation details, typically using abstract classes and pure virtual functions.

These concepts enhance code modularity, reusability, and maintainability.
