What is the difference between OOP and POP? 

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
- Focus : Objects and classes.
- Key Concepts : Encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction.
- Advantage : Modular, reusable, and easier to maintain.

Procedure-Oriented Programming (POP):
- Focus : Functions and procedures.
- Key Concepts : Functions operate on global or passed data.
- Advantage : Simpler for straightforward tasks; data and functions are separate.

In essence, OOP organizes code around objects, while POP organizes it around functions.
